In this project I had to create a  budjet tracker using what we learned so far with AngularJS. It was a really enjoyed using this project for real world scenarios to see my spending. We were tasked to you two way binding to display data as well as use other AngjularJS directives like ng-clicks and ng-repeat. The biggest challenge I had on this project was getting a grasp on how AngularJS works and how it connects on the js side of the code.
